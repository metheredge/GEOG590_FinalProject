# GEOG590_FinalProject: Galeras, Volcano and Popocatepetl, Volcano SO2 Emission Trends (2008-2013) 

SO2 gas emission measurements near volcanos can provide many understandings of volcanic eruptions and hazards. When recorded, the trends of these measurements can hold value in predicting future volcanic eruptions. Two volcanos that have many years of SO2 gas measurements is Galeras,Volcano in Colombia and Popocatepetl, Volcano in Mexico. Galeras and Popocatepetl are two extremely active volcanos that have many data to anaylze to provide much insight into SO2 trends of volcanos around the world. 

This code does a series of simple data analyses of the SO2 flux data set from NOVAC (Network for Observation of Volcanic and Atmospheric Change) for both Galeras and Popocatepetl. NOVAC takes daily measurements of SO2 using specometers that measure emmited SO2 wavelengths. This code aims to identify trends from Galeras and Popocatepetl from the years 2008-2013. These two volcanos and years were picked because it has the most data and the largest overlap of time.

Outline:

1: Daily Mean Trends of SO2 for Galeras and Popocatepetl                        
2. Yearly Trends of SO2 for Galeras and Popocatepetl                            
3. Total Sum of SO2 of Galeras and Popocatepetl                                 
4. Histogram of Yearly Trends
